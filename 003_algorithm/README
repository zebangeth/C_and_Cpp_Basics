This problem is intended for you to practice the basics of algorithmic
development and execution by hand that you learned in Chapter 1. Note: the
practice problems for Chapter 1 are section 1.9 Practice Exercises.

Here is what you need to do:

 (1) Find a partner.  
 (2) One of you should do Question 1.7 from the practice problems in AoP. The
     other should do Question 1.8 from AoP. 
 (3) Notice that step 3 of each problem asks you to give your algorithm to your
     partner. When you both finish writing your algorithm and executing it for
     N=6, swap algorithms with your partner. Execute your partner's algorithm
     and compare answers. Did you get the same answers? Was something ambiguous
     in the algorithm? Did you find the patterns correctly?

 (4) After you finish, create a file in this directory called "done.txt" and write

     Yes, we did this!

     in that file. After you have done that, save the file, add it to git,
     commit it, push it, and submit this assignment for grading (if you do not
     remember how, look back at 000_submit).
